## The State Purity Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and inspired by the [Rice Purity Test](http://ricepuritytest.com/).

### How To Interpret the Test

Each question answered in the original Rice Purity Test would be subtracted from a total of 100. A score of 100 would be totally pure, while a score of 0 would mean you are an absolutely depraved person. <br/>
While these tests are just for fun, the original test would not discriminate on how each act would impact your overall score. Using methamphetamine would be considered equal to holding hands by this logic (but honestly, pre-marital hand holding is pretty messed up).<br/>

### How Questions Are Weighted

The State Purity Test assigns a weight to every question.<br >

There are 20 minor acts, which each have a weight of 1.<br/>
There are 30 immoral acts, which each have a weight of 2.<br/>
There are 20 raunchy acts, which each have a weight of 3.<br/>
There are 20 scandalous acts, which each have a weight of 4.<br/>
There are 10 unspeakable acts, which each have a weight of 5.<br/>

It's not perfect, and weights were assigned at my discretion, so none of this is really objective, but it gives a better picture of your purity if you're trying to compare your scores with another person.
